## Steps to set up the application environment and run the application <a name='setup'></a>
</br>
For this explanation we will be setting up the environment on Visual Studio Code so ensure that this is first downloaded and installed before following the next steps. </br>

If you do not have Visual Studio Code downloaded on your personal computer [You can download it here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
1. Download and install git onto your personal computer. [You can download it here](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
2. Install the "GitHub Pull Requests and Issues" extension on Visual Studio Code. 
3. Restart your Visual Studio Code and now you should be able to see an option of "Clone Repository" under the "Open Folder" option.
4. Open and log into GitHub on your web browser.
5. Enter "WPR281_Project_2022" into the search bar on GitHub. 
6. Copy the URL of the project.
7. Paste this URL in Visual Studio Code where it says "Provide repository URL or pick a repository source" and press ENTER. 
8. This will now allow you to choose a folder where you would like to save the project. 
9. Once you have chosen the folder select "Select Repository Location".
10. A popup window will appear where you can select open to open the application environment. 
11. If you do not have it already installed we recommend installing the extension called "Live Server".
12. Once this is installed you can right-click on the .html file and choose "Open with Live Server".
13. You should now see the bug tracker login page on your local host.
